# Introduction 
My project is a website to check and compare steam prices.
Currently, this will only show up the current prices from the steam store.

## Wireframe

Here is a short explanation of my wireframe image

### Initial Idea

Note: This was the initial idea to my project look. I was influenced by the idea of having a very easy to use and familiar layout to steam

### Initial Webpage

Note: This is one of my stretch goals for the project. A great "straight to the point" webpage that easily direct to the website that contains the lowest price for the game

### Webpage showing detailed info about a single game

# Description
This project is currently able to grab your steam wishlist API and display it on the wishlist webpage. Currently you can click on each individual game on the wishlist to then get more details on what game it is. Details include: genres, prices, release date, steam deck compatibility, and whether or not it is a free game.

# Instructions
1. Go to website
2. (Option A) Sign up for the website; 
<br>(Option B) If you already signed up, login to your account
3. (Option A) Click on 'Get Started' or click on the wishlist tab at the top of the page so that you can input your Steam ID (follow directions on the webpage); <br>
(Option B) If you already assigned your Steam ID to your profile, click on wishlist to see your current wishlist on steam.
4. Edit Or delete each game item on the webpage for each individual game on your wishlist

# Prosepective Ideas
In the near future, I would like to all the ideas I had within my wireframe. Furthermore, I would love to have more than just the steam website on each indiviual game's detailed info so that buyers can choose which website they want to buy from. Further ideas include but not limited to:
1. Website redesign like a background image for each game's detailed info webpage
2. More api to manipulate so that I can add more websites to the page
3. Expanding the games list page for a quick and easy access for people who may not be logged in
4. More edit and delete routes on different parts of the website
